Hi, I'm **Bite Ye**. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from [**George Washington University**](https://www.gwu.edu/) in 2021 and 2023, where I was advised by [**Gabriel Parmer**](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/). Currently, I am a student at [**MPI-SWS**](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) under the supervision of [**Bj√∂rn B. Brandenburg**](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/).

### Research Interests
My main research area is in **Real-time & Embedded Systems**. I focus on ensuring predictable and reliable performance in embedded systems, particularly in time-critical environments.

### Technical Skills
I am proficient in **C** and have extensive experience with the **Linux kernel**, including a strong understanding of **eBPF**. My work often involves deep system-level programming and performance optimizations.

### Professional Experience
Before pursuing my studies at MPI-SWS, I worked at [**XPeng**](https://en.xiaopeng.com/), a leading electric vehicle manufacturer in China, in the **Platform Department**'s performance team, where I focused on optimizing system performance.

### Side Projects
While I previously contributed to **LineageOS** and **Magisk** in the Android community, I am no longer actively involved. These experiences, however, gave me valuable insights into open-source development and the Android ecosystem.

### Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, which helps me unwind from research and technical challenges.
